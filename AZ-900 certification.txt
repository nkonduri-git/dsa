dedicated server
one machine to one business
virtual private server:
 
one physical machine dedicated to a single business
the single machine is virtualized into sub-machine 
shared hosting 1 server used by multiple business
cloud
multiple machine that acts as one system 

there could be 100 of cloud services the 4 most services for iaas would be 
cloud
pay for what you use
can be used anywhere
cloud services secure by default
data backup
inc or dec resources on demand 
automate the scaling during the spikes and drops in demand elastic
services
saas software as a service
a product that is run and managed by the service provider 
paas focus on deployment and management of your apps 
iaas infrastructure as a service 
provides access to networking ,computers and  data storage 
public cloud
the cloud provider has the whole infrastructure
private cloud
if a company or org has its own servers amd cloud 
hybrid
both private and public
on premises cost is high and cloud cost is less

capex is costly and opex is simple and cost effective
solutions architect
a technical org that a architect a technical solution using the multiple systems
cloud architect:
a solutions architect that is focused on architecting the technical solutions using the cloud services
------
a cloud architect must ensure the service available at high 
scalability:your ability to grow rapidly
elasticity:your ability to shrink and grow to reach demands
high availability : services remain available anytime
load balancer used to evenly distribute the traffic between multiple servers in one data centre
high scalability: vertical one bigger server and horizontal add multiple serves 
high elasticity: ability to automatically increase or decrese your capacity based on demand
horizontal scling:
scaling out: add more servers of same size 
scaling in:removing more servers of same size 
azure vm scale sets automatically inc or dec in response to demand or a defined schedule 
highly fault tolerant: no single point of failure 

-----
fail-overs : is when you have plan to shift to a reduant system in case primary fail secondary all the data synced from primary
azure traffic manager: which is a dns based traffic balancer to fail-over from a primary system to a standy-secondary system
high durability:
recover from a disaster and prevent the loss of data 
business continuity plan:
unplanned disruption then how business continues 
recovery point objective:
the max accepeteble data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident 
recovery-time objective:how muc hamount of downtime your business can tolerate without any loss 
disaster recovery options: 
low -- backup and restore
backup your data and restore it to new infrastructure.hours time taken
pilot light: data is replicated to another region with the minimal serviced running 10 min 
warm standby:scaled down copy of your infrastructure running ready to scale up minutes 
multi site active;scaled up copy of your infrsstructure in another region real-time

the evolution of computing:
dedicated:a physical server wholly utilized by single customer 
you will overpay for the underutilized server but security is high and privacy full 

capex  vs                                                    opex
spending money upfront 
like infrastructure                                   the cost paid for only leasing soft             


          
                                            training employees in cloud services 
                                                       paying for cloud support

solutions architect
technical solution using multiple systems 
cloud architect:
solely on architecting the technical solutions using cloud services 

cloud architect need to understand the 
availability-your ability to ensure a service remains available
scalability-your ability to grow rapidly
elasticity-your ability to shrink or grow to meet the demand
fault-tolerance-your ability to prevent failure
disaster recovery-your ability to recover to recover from failure

aavailabilty - load balancer used so that one place server down route to other if its in other data centre more preferable as it is more effective one data centre fail
high scalabilty:
inc your capacity based on traffic 2 scalings
1)vertical in one server space inc
2)horizontal add servers
high elasticity;
inc or dec capacity based on demand
scaling out- inc servers
scaling in- remove more servers
avm vm scale set automatically inc or dec in response to demand 
high fault tolerant:
preventing the chance of failure:
by making the copy of the production database
azure traffic manager used 
high durability:
recover from loss of data 
business continuity plan
how a business will continue to operate even when there is a unplanned disruption 
recovery point objective : the max amount of data loss which is acceptable after an unplanned data loss occurs
recovery time objective:the max amount of downtime your business can handle without a  big loss 
the evolution of computing
1)dedicated wasted space 
2)vm(virtual machines):you can run multiple virtual machines on one machine 
we can share with the other customers 
so that fraction only charged 
but you are limited by the usage of the guest os and resource sharing problem occurs 
3)containers:vm can run multiple containers 
docker deamon is the name of soft layer that lets you run a multiple container 
more cost effective 
multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to the same os 
4)functions;

even further subdivided into small parts apps further divided 
a managed vm running managed containers
serverless compute it is called
choose the piece code and memory and time of utilization that is what we pay
region grouping of multiple data centres 
azure 58 groups across 140 countries 

a geography 
azure geography is a discrete market of two or more regions that preserves data residency data stays native to country and compliance boundry 
each region is paired with the another region 300 miles away only one region is updated at a time to ensure no outages 

not all azure services available at all regions 
recommended region that provides the broadcast range of service capabilities and support available zones 
alt regions 
a region that extends azures footprint within 
not designed to support az
general availability: when service ready to be used by everyone 

\azure services grouped into 3 categories
1)foundational:when ga immediately or in 12 month in recommended and alt regions
2)mainstream when ga immediately or in 12 month in recommended may be available in alt regions 
3)specialized : available in recommended or alternative region beased on customers demand
special regions meet their compliance 
availability zones the zones containing the one or more datacentres
region = 3 az
choosing the number of az means that zone will be placed the data 
some regions no az available
fault domain:
a logical grouping of hardware to avoid a single point of failure within an az group of virtual machines that share a common power source
update domain:
azure make sure you update the underlaying hardware and software make sure they dont go offline
availability set:
vm in availability set are different fault/update domains to avoid downtime
1`availability set multiple domains present on if suppose 1 rack 3 fd then 1 down other 2 operational 
azure computing services:
1)azure vm
windows or Linux machines used you can choose your own os,memory,cpu
2)azure container 
docker as a service run containerized apps on azured without provising the servers
3)azure Kubernetes services:
easy to deploy manage and scale containerized application
4)azure service fabric:
tier-1 enterprise containers as service
distributed systems platform runs in azure or on-premises 
easy to package deploy and manage and reliable 
5)azure functions:
serverless compute runs code without managing the server
short time run once done underlying servers shutting down
6)azure batch:
plans schedules and executes your batch computer workloads across multiple 100+ jobs in parallel
virtual machine:
lets u use a server without having to buy the server
the size determined by the image
azure vm billed by hourly rate
azure launch creates a lot of components like
nsg(network security group) : attached to the nic which provides the rules around the ports and protocals 
network interface: a device that handles ip protocals 
virtual machine instance: the actual server
Microsoft supports lots of os you can also bring your own version of the Linux by creating it using the Linux virtual hard disk
az fault domains:
a logical grouping of hardware to avoid single point of failure 
update domain:
update to hardware and software
availability set : a logical grou[ing in azure to ensure that vm you place in the availability set are different fault/update domain to avoid downtimes
operating system:
that manages all the programs in your system
azure scale set:
allows you to automatically inc or dec the capacity 
create a scaling policies to automatically add or remove based on host metrics 
create a health checks 
1)load balancer:
evenly distribute the vm across the multiple availability zone 
load balancer 2 types:
1)application gateway https web traffic load balancer
2)azure load balancer tcp/udp network traffic 

scaling policy:
scale out:when an instance should be added to scale set to increase capacity
cpu per, no of vm and after how long
scale in: reduce capacity removed to dec capacity 
after scale set you have lot of options to configure the rule
aggregates after collect what to do 
if we want more insights in the app
we will install app insights:a small instrumental package i  your application that monitprs app and sends infor azure
azure diagnostics :it is an agent runs inside a vm instance  
scale-in policy:which vm must be removed when decrese the capacity

default delete the one with the highest instance id 
delete the oldest vm and deleted the newest vm
update policy:
determine how vm inst are brought up-to date 
1)automatic:
inc with the start upgrading immediately 
2)manual:
exisiting instance manually upgrade
3)rolling:
upgrades roll out in batches with optional pause 
health monitoring:
used to analysis if our server is healthy or unhealthy

two modes of health monitoring:
application health extension:
 ping an http request to a specific path and expect a status of 200 
load balancer probe:
 allow you to check based on tcp,udp or http r4equest
automatic repair 
if an instance found to be unhealthy and launch new instance
Microsoft azure virtual desktop desktop and app virtualization service it works across all the devices like windows ios can access remote apps
safety high

advantages
it provides full windows desktop virtualization 
and also great integreation with the Microsoft 365  app 
-reduce cost of licensing and infrastructure
-protect against outages
-manages the virtual desktop infrastructure
azure also provides the app services
azure app services:
load balance
autoscaling
automated manager


azure app services 3 tiers and also create a unique name because it becomes its own domain


runtimes
a runtime software that are excuted while your program is running
a runtime means what 
deployment slots:
allows you to create different env of your web applications asscoaited to different host name 
azure app service env:
fully isolated env provide for securely running the app 
azure deployment slots apps we create multiple slots so that 1 has copy of other so that we can make changes in one and replace or swap with production
multiple ase can be created within single az region  ase ideal for horizontal scaling
ase external 
ilb
azure contaners instance:
package,deploy,manage cloud applications using containers fully managed docker as a service 
azure container instance: allows you to launch containers without the need to worry about the configuration or managing the underlying vm 
azure container instance is designed for 
1)simple application 
2)task automation
containers can be started in sec 
containers per sec charged
containers have custom sizing
containers can deploy both the windows and Linux
conatiners group:
are collection of conatiners that get scheduled on the same host machine.
this containers share the:
lifecycle
resources
localnetwork
storage
multi-containers only support Linux containers now
2 way to deploy 
1)resource manager template
yaml file
containers restart policies
container env variable:
allow you to pass conf details to your container
azure portals we can set that
azure container doesnot store data that is generated with in the cycle
which you can mount by using the azure file
secret volume
which can be done by using the giving the data in the power shell
azure-file-volume-share-name: filename
azure vnet
we will launch our resources in that network
azure dns own dns domain manage 
azure vnet is a logically isolated section of azure network vnet multiple vnets attach which can be used as a 1 network
they are 2 1)regional regional vnets peer
2)global global vnets peer
nic
it is a hardware component that connects the computer to computer 
nic communicate with the ip
azure subnet virtual isolation with in thr network
subnet 1 route table needed so that we can access 
azure no prv or public subnet
network sec can be kept
azure dns(domain name service)
it is a service translating a service name to its ip address 
azure domains public allows you to manage the domains for internet access domains
pointing your domain to your website
private dns allows you to use your own custom domains instead of the azure provided domains

virtual private network:extends a private network in public network gateway:
it is a software for vpn it will deploy 2 vms they and ateway services
