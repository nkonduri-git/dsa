AZ-900 certification
 
dedicated server
one machine to one business
virtual private server:
 
one physical machine dedicated to a single business
the single machine is virtualized into sub-machine 
shared hosting 1 server used by multiple business
cloud
multiple machine that acts as one system 

there could be 100 of cloud services the 4 most services for iaas would be 
cloud
pay for what you use
can be used anywhere
cloud services secure by default
data backup
inc or dec resources on demand 
automate the scaling during the spikes and drops in demand elastic
services
saas software as a service
a product that is run and managed by the service provider 
paas focus on deployment and management of your apps 
iaas infrastructure as a service 
provides access to networking ,computers and  data storage 
public cloud
the cloud provider has the whole infrastructure
private cloud
if a company or org has its own servers amd cloud 
hybrid
both private and public
on premises cost is high and cloud cost is less

capex is costly and opex is simple and cost effective
solutions architect
a technical org that a architect a technical solution using the multiple systems
cloud architect:
a solutions architect that is focused on architecting the technical solutions using the cloud services
------
a cloud architect must ensure the service available at high 
scalability:your ability to grow rapidly
elasticity:your ability to shrink and grow to reach demands
high availability : services remain available anytime
load balancer used to evenly distribute the traffic between multiple servers in one data centre
high scalability: vertical one bigger server and horizontal add multiple serves 
high elasticity: ability to automatically increase or decrese your capacity based on demand
horizontal scling:
scaling out: add more servers of same size 
scaling in:removing more servers of same size 
azure vm scale sets automatically inc or dec in response to demand or a defined schedule 
highly fault tolerant: no single point of failure 

-----
fail-overs : is when you have plan to shift to a reduant system in case primary fail secondary all the data synced from primary
azure traffic manager: which is a dns based traffic balancer to fail-over from a primary system to a standy-secondary system
high durability:
recover from a disaster and prevent the loss of data 
business continuity plan:
unplanned disruption then how business continues 
recovery point objective:
the max accepeteble data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident 
recovery-time objective:how muc hamount of downtime your business can tolerate without any loss 
disaster recovery options: 
low -- backup and restore
backup your data and restore it to new infrastructure.hours time taken
pilot light: data is replicated to another region with the minimal serviced running 10 min 
warm standby:scaled down copy of your infrastructure running ready to scale up minutes 
multi site active;scaled up copy of your infrsstructure in another region real-time

the evolution of computing:
dedicated:a physical server wholly utilized by single customer 
you will overpay for the underutilized server but security is high and privacy full
