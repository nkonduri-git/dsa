AZ-900 certification
 
dedicated server
one machine to one business
virtual private server:
 
one physical machine dedicated to a single business
the single machine is virtualized into sub-machine 
shared hosting 1 server used by multiple business
cloud
multiple machine that acts as one system 

there could be 100 of cloud services the 4 most services for iaas would be 
cloud
pay for what you use
can be used anywhere
cloud services secure by default
data backup
inc or dec resources on demand 
automate the scaling during the spikes and drops in demand elastic
services
saas software as a service
a product that is run and managed by the service provider 
paas focus on deployment and management of your apps 
iaas infrastructure as a service 
provides access to networking ,computers and  data storage 
public cloud
the cloud provider has the whole infrastructure
private cloud
if a company or org has its own servers amd cloud 
hybrid
both private and public
on premises cost is high and cloud cost is less

capex is costly and opex is simple and cost effective
solutions architect
a technical org that a architect a technical solution using the multiple systems
cloud architect:
a solutions architect that is focused on architecting the technical solutions using the cloud services
------
a cloud architect must ensure the service available at high 
scalability:your ability to grow rapidly
elasticity:your ability to shrink and grow to reach demands
high availability : services remain available anytime
load balancer used to evenly distribute the traffic between multiple servers in one data centre
high scalability: vertical one bigger server and horizontal add multiple serves 
high elasticity: ability to automatically increase or decrese your capacity based on demand
horizontal scling:
scaling out: add more servers of same size 
scaling in:removing more servers of same size 
azure vm scale sets automatically inc or dec in response to demand or a defined schedule 
highly fault tolerant: no single point of failure 

-----
fail-overs : is when you have plan to shift to a reduant system in case primary fail secondary all the data synced from primary
azure traffic manager: which is a dns based traffic balancer to fail-over from a primary system to a standy-secondary system
high durability:
recover from a disaster and prevent the loss of data 
business continuity plan:
unplanned disruption then how business continues 
recovery point objective:
the max accepeteble data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident 
recovery-time objective:how muc hamount of downtime your business can tolerate without any loss 
disaster recovery options: 
low -- backup and restore
backup your data and restore it to new infrastructure.hours time taken
pilot light: data is replicated to another region with the minimal serviced running 10 min 
warm standby:scaled down copy of your infrastructure running ready to scale up minutes 
multi site active;scaled up copy of your infrsstructure in another region real-time

the evolution of computing:
dedicated:a physical server wholly utilized by single customer 
you will overpay for the underutilized server but security is high and privacy full 

capex  vs                                                    opex
spending money upfront 
like infrastructure                                   the cost paid for only leasing soft             


          
                                            training employees in cloud services 
                                                       paying for cloud support

solutions architect
technical solution using multiple systems 
cloud architect:
solely on architecting the technical solutions using cloud services 

cloud architect need to understand the 
availability-your ability to ensure a service remains available
scalability-your ability to grow rapidly
elasticity-your ability to shrink or grow to meet the demand
fault-tolerance-your ability to prevent failure
disaster recovery-your ability to recover to recover from failure

aavailabilty - load balancer used so that one place server down route to other if its in other data centre more preferable as it is more effective one data centre fail
high scalabilty:
inc your capacity based on traffic 2 scalings
1)vertical in one server space inc
2)horizontal add servers
high elasticity;
inc or dec capacity based on demand
scaling out- inc servers
scaling in- remove more servers
avm vm scale set automatically inc or dec in response to demand 
high fault tolerant:
preventing the chance of failure:
by making the copy of the production database
azure traffic manager used 
high durability:
recover from loss of data 
business continuity plan
how a business will continue to operate even when there is a unplanned disruption 
recovery point objective : the max amount of data loss which is acceptable after an unplanned data loss occurs
recovery time objective:the max amount of downtime your business can handle without a  big loss 
the evolution of computing
1)dedicated wasted space 
2)vm(virtual machines):you can run multiple virtual machines on one machine 
we can share with the other customers 
so that fraction only charged 
but you are limited by the usage of the guest os and resource sharing problem occurs 
3)containers:vm can run multiple containers 
docker deamon is the name of soft layer that lets you run a multiple container 
more cost effective 
multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to the same os 
4)functions;

even further subdivided into small parts apps further divided 
a managed vm running managed containers
serverless compute it is called
choose the piece code and memory and time of utilization that is what we pay
region grouping of multiple data centres 
azure 58 groups across 140 countries 

a geography 
azure geography is a discrete market of two or more regions that preserves data residency data stays native to country and compliance boundry 
each region is paired with the another region 300 miles away only one region is updated at a time to ensure no outages 

not all azure services available at all regions 
recommended region that provides the broadcast range of service capabilities and support available zones 
alt regions 
a region that extends azures footprint within 
not designed to support az
general availability: when service ready to be used by everyone 

\azure services grouped into 3 categories
1)foundational:when ga immediately or in 12 month in recommended and alt regions
2)mainstream when ga immediately or in 12 month in recommended may be available in alt regions 
3)specialized : available in recommended or alternative region beased on customers demand
special regions meet their compliance 
availability zones the zones containing the one or more datacentres
region = 3 az
choosing the number of az means that zone will be placed the data 
some regions no az available
fault domain:
a logical grouping of hardware to avoid a single point of failure within an az group of virtual machines that share a common power source
update domain:
azure make sure you update the underlaying hardware and software make sure they dont go offline
availability set:
vm in availability set are different fault/update domains to avoid downtime
1`availability set multiple domains present on if suppose 1 rack 3 fd then 1 down other 2 operational 
azure computing services:
1)azure vm
windows or Linux machines used you can choose your own os,memory,cpu
2)azure container 
docker as a service run containerized apps on azured without provising the servers
3)azure Kubernetes services:
easy to deploy manage and scale containerized application
4)azure service fabric:
tier-1 enterprise containers as service
distributed systems platform runs in azure or on-premises 
easy to package deploy and manage and reliable 
5)azure functions:
serverless compute runs code without managing the server
short time run once done underlying servers shutting down
6)azure batch:
plans schedules and executes your batch computer workloads across multiple 100+ jobs in parallel
virtual machine:
lets u use a server without having to buy the server
the size determined by the image
azure vm billed by hourly rate
azure launch creates a lot of components like
nsg(network security group) : attached to the nic which provides the rules around the ports and protocals 
network interface: a device that handles ip protocals 
virtual machine instance: the actual server
Microsoft supports lots of os you can also bring your own version of the Linux by creating it using the Linux virtual hard disk
