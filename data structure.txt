calculating the run time of an algorithm
asymptotic analysis 
if input size increase the running time increase

big o notation
f(n)<=c g(n)

big o fastest growing consider 
log base not consider 
constant order is 1 
we need to calculate the running time of the algorithm 
then calculate the big o notation
